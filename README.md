Make a checklist of what your bot can do. You should not give it administrator privileges, as then it can control your server. 
Feel free to let it mute or ban members, prioritize speakers, add reactions, embed links, manage nicknames, and much more. 
Each level of permission provided by you has its own unique ID you can see on the dashboard itself.
